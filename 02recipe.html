<h2>This is a simple Tortilla Pizza recipe that was originally posted to <a href="http://cookieandkate.com/"> Cookie and Kate. </a> </h2>
 
<h3>Ingredients: </h3>
<ul> <li>1 whole wheat tortilla (or whole wheat pita bread) </li>
<li>1/4 cup sauce (marinara, pesto, olive oil and garlic, barbecue sauce)</li>
<li>1/3 cup or less shredded/crumbled cheese (mozzarella, cheddar, goat, feta)</li>
<li>Toppings (go wild!) </li></ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ul><li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
<li>Place the tortilla in a 12-inch cast iron pan (see notes on baking surfaces below).</li> <li>Spread sauce evenly across the tortilla, leaving 1/2 inch around the edges.</li> <li>Sprinkle with cheese and toppings.</li>
<li>Bake for 12-14 minutes, until the cheese is golden and bubbling <em>(no sooner!)</em> and the edges of the tortilla are lightly browned.</li> <li>Slice and serve.</li></ul>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul> <li>If you don’t have a cast iron skillet I highly recommend getting one, but you can use an oven-safe baking rack or bake it directly on the rack of your toaster oven instead.</li> 
<li>Bake at 400 degrees for 8 to 11 minutes.</li>
<li>Do not use a regular baking sheet because the bottom of the tortilla will not get crispy, your cheese will slide right off and you’ll wish you ordered out.</li></ul>
<ul>
  <li>Although I have not tried it personally, Kim tried making tortilla pizzas in her cast iron skillet on a gas grill and said they turned out great!</li>
<li><em>Make sure to check the ingredients list on the whole wheat tortillas. It should list about 5 ingredients, not 25. I buy mine at health food stores and store them in the fridge or freezer and they almost never go bad.</em></li></ul>

<h3>Topping Ideas:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>As shown: barbecue sauce <em>(trust me)</em>, fresh mozzarella and sharp cheddar cheese, chopped red onion, sliced fresh jalapeño, fresh or defrosted frozen pineapple (canned pineapple is not as good).</li>
<li>Basil pesto, feta, fresh or roasted bell peppers(jarred is fine), sliced kalamata olives, chopped red onion, sliced cherry tomatoes.</li>
<li>Arugula pesto, basil pesto or light marinara sauce, mozzarella <em>(optional)</em>, fresh arugula and parmesan shavings added after baking (like this).</li>
<li>Red pepper pesto and goat cheese.</li>
<li>Anything you want!</li>
</ul>
