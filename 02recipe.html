<h2>This is a simple Tortilla Pizza recipe that was originally posted to <a href="http://cookieandkate.com/"> Cookie and Kate. </a> </h2>
 
<h3>Ingredients: </h3>

      <ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">1 whole wheat tortilla (or whole wheat pita bread)</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">1/4 cup sauce (marinara, pesto, olive oil and garlic, barbecue sauce)</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">1/3 cup or less shredded/crumbled cheese (mozzarella, cheddar, goat, feta)</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Toppings (go wild!)</li>

</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
       <ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Place the tortilla in a 12-inch cast iron pan (see notes on baking surfaces below).</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Spread sauce evenly across the tortilla, leaving 1/2 inch around the edges.</li> 
  <li class="list-group-item">Sprinkle with cheese and toppings</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Bake for 12-14 minutes, until the cheese is golden and bubbling <em>(no sooner!)</em> and the edges of the tortilla are lightly browned.</li>


</ul>


<h3>Notes:</h3>
      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
       <ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">If you don’t have a cast iron skillet I highly recommend getting one, but you can use an oven-safe baking rack or bake it directly on the rack of your toaster oven instead.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Bake at 400 degrees for 8 to 11 minutes.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Do not use a regular baking sheet because the bottom of the tortilla will not get crispy, your cheese will slide right off and you’ll wish you ordered out.</li> 
  <li class="list-group-item">Although I have not tried it personally, Kim tried making tortilla pizzas in her cast iron skillet on a gas grill and said they turned out great!</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Make sure to check the ingredients list on the whole wheat tortillas. It should list about 5 ingredients, not 25. I buy mine at health food stores and store them in the fridge or freezer and they almost never go bad</li>

</ul>

<h3>Topping Ideas:</h3>
<img src="images/tortilla-pizza-recipe4.jpg" alt="tortilla pizza recipe"/>
             <ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">As shown: barbecue sauce <em>(trust me)</em>, fresh mozzarella and sharp cheddar cheese, chopped red onion, sliced fresh jalapeño, fresh or defrosted frozen pineapple (canned pineapple is not as good).</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Basil pesto, feta, fresh or roasted bell peppers(jarred is fine), sliced kalamata olives, chopped red onion, sliced cherry tomatoes.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Arugula pesto, basil pesto or light marinara sauce, mozzarella <em>(optional)</em>, fresh arugula and parmesan shavings added after baking (like this).</li> 
  <li class="list-group-item">Red pepper pesto and goat cheese.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Anything you want!</li>

</ul>
