          <h4> My Thoughts: </h4>
            <p> This video, by Brad Frost, highlighted the shocking statistics of our usage of the Internet and mobile apps today, as well as talking about what is important in how we use it. He states that there are 40 million photos uploaded to social media every single day. 380 billion photos were taken last year, meaning that 10 % of photos in general were taken last year. Each household has an average of 118 channels to choose from. Netflix occupies ⅓ of all the Internets bandwidth. 500 million tweets are sent out each day. These are just a few of the shocking numbers he gives us. He wanted to show that we are constantly being given information and we want to constantly feel as if we are receiving it all. He mentions how we are always trying to get the red dots down, meaning all of our apps notifications. While we are doing this, we face bullshit. Plain and simple, he says it is all the unnecessary and complex things that show up on our webpages: the overlays asking us to take a survey or to sign up for a newsletter. In addition to this, he believes that advertising falls under this category of bullshit because no one actually clicks on the banner ads or takes the time to watch an ad that is longer than the YouTube video they want to watch. He says craft, focus, respect, and originality is what is needed. Craft- to show that we do not need all the excess advertising, etc to have a successful product. Focus- people will find ways to get around the bullshit. Respect- respect peoples time and realize the hard work that went into it. Be original- and have passion. I think that those four things are key. </p>
      
        <h4> Three Things I learned:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li> We spend 4 billion hours on YouTube </li>
          <li> 90 % of all data was created just in the last two years. </li>
          <li> Things can be successful without all the hoopla surround it like advertising, etc. (Ex: Siracha product has no social media pages or anything) </li>

<h2>Video #2: 10 Things I Didn't Know About HTML</h2>
        <ul> 
         <div class="speaker"> <li>Speaker: Mathias Bynens <a href="http://vimeo.com/89935203"> Video Link </a></li></div> </ul> 
          <h4> My Thoughts: </h4>
            <p> Mathia Bynens describes ten things he did not know about HTML in his video. He describes what is valid code and how you can omit or add things to make it valid, as well as how validating may not be as important as one thinks anymore. He says that validators can only check for two of the three layers of performance criteria. Therefore, people should not obsess over validating their code because although it is a great tool to use, it has problems as well. He also talks about the use of the semicolon and how it is critically important, because without one, many things are changed from how you want them. Although the semicolon seems to be optional, it is mandatory. The main thing I got from his talk is to use quotes whenever you are in doubt! He also talks about some things he did not know about JavaScript.
 </p>
        <h4> Three Things I learned: </h4> <ol>
          <li> You can omit head and body closing tags. You can also omit opening tags. It is still valid because the browser will auto generate these implied elements (html, body). </li>
          <li> You do not need quotes if there is whitespace in the font-family name.</li>
          <li> If the font-family starts with a number, you need to use quotes. </li>

        <h2>Video #3: Designing with Details</h2>
        <ul>
          <div class="speaker"> <li> Speaker: Dan Saffer, <a href="http://vimeo.com/album/2784294/video/89543518"> Video Link </a> </li></div>
               </ul>
          <h4> My Thoughts: </h4>
            <p> I really enjoyed Dan Saffer’s talk on designing with details. I really never thought of those little things that go into designing a device or website. His whole talk was based around micro interactions. He starts with the example of silencing your phone to begin to describe what micro interactions do. He says, “They do one thing and they do it well”. Even though these features are not promoted, they completely change the whole user experience. Some examples are: liking something, adding a contact, commenting, giving a rating. All of these things are small and often overlooked, yet make a huge difference in our user experience. He says these micro interactions are the difference between a product you absolutely love, and one you just learn to tolerate. He believes that paying attention to details is important, and could cause micro interactions to become signature moments that increase customer loyalty. The Facebook ‘like’ button and AOL’s ‘you’ve got mail’ are signature to those services, and if they did not have them their whole brand would be seen differently. I like when Saffer says that you do not need to start from zero because there is at least one thing known about the user on the device, so use that and make the product better and more customized. His whole talk was fascinating because I never thought of all of these little things and how they affect my user experience. I will definitely be paying attention to these more. </p>
        <h4> Three Things I learned: </h4> <ol>
          <li> Details matter. People want to feel as if they are being paid attention to and have their needs met. These details will make a difference. </li>
          <li>There are two types of triggers, manual and system. Some manual triggers are sliding up on your iPhone and getting to the camera. Some system triggers are bringing data forward, like on the weather icon actually having the weather show up. </li>
          <li>By starting from the bottom-up and thinking small, things can be changed for the better. Overtime, micro interactions can be adjusted and more polished. </li>
