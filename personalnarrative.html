          <h1>Personal Narrative</h1>
      
<p>My final website is an online personal portfolio that features all of the work I am most proud of and want to show off. It features my resume, references, as well as writing samples and some of my photography. It links to all of my social media accounts, my blog, and has all of my contact information there also. I wanted to create this because as a Communications Major, it is important to have a website when you begin looking for jobs. In fact, some companies will not even glance at your resume and cover letter if you do not have some sort of online portfolio. I pictured my audience being potential employers, classmates, teachers, and friends and family. Therefore, I thought that I would use the opportunity of this classâ€™s final project to begin creating my site. </p>
      
<p>To create this website, I first started by making a sitemap and decided what content I wanted on it. From here, I looked to some websites for inspiration and design ideas for placing my content. I knew I wanted a very simple layout with my initials very prominent, since it is a page representing me and who I am. I chose all white with one stand out color, a shade of light green, to add some contrast and detail. I added the green in the header, navbar, and footer, so it was there enough, but still remained simply white throughout as well. I thought this would guide the viewer in a way that was easy, yet still eye catching. I added a picture of myself on the sidebar of each page because I thought it added a personal touch. Each page has the same layout because I wanted it to be simple and predictable. Sometimes I think when things are too busy the content gets lost, and I certainly did not want that to happen. </p>

      <p>I utilized Bootstrap to make my navigation bar and grid for my photography page. I began creating a nav bar without bootstrap, but bootstrap sped up the process to the point that I liked how it looked better. I customized my navigation bar from the template bootstrap gave by removing the drop down menu option. I also took out the search bar. I just wanted a simple nav bar with only links to the pages I created. I also changed the background color so it fit better with my whole websites theme. For the grid on my photography page, I simply took the template and customized how many rows and columns I wanted. </p>
      
<p>I faced many challenges while creating this website because it is hard to have this beautiful image in your head of what you want your website to be and then actually execute it. I think all of my ideas require more web design experience. For instance, making the sidebar was quite difficult because I wanted the text to overlay on my picture and on top of that have social media icons fit there as well. I wanted the social media icons to fit next to each other horizontally. All of these things sound very simple, but it was hard to know how to actually make it happen in HTML and CSS. Another challenge was creating the headings and paragraph on each page. I wanted a border around them and have them be centered, but it was hard at first to know how to do this. Eventually, by creating containers, I was able to execute. Another challenge was my photography page. I wanted some sort of photo gallery, and in class you mentioned a bootstrap grid so I used that. However, it was not working for a while and I got really frustrated. It took me awhile to figure out how to neatly put them in the grid, but it eventually happened and I am happy with how it turned out.  </p>
      
<p>Overall, I really enjoyed created this portfolio for myself. I actually cannot believe that I created a whole website, even though it is very simple, mostly by myself. I learned so many skills and tips that will definitely come in handy for future html and css work. It was a great learning process and all of mistakes have taught me lessons that are extremely valuable. I am looking forward to learning about web design more in depth next semester. <p>
